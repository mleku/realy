nostr relay built from a heavily modified fork
of https://github.com/nbd-wtf/go-nostr[nbd-wtf/go-nostr]
and https://github.com/fiatjaf/relayer[fiatjaf/relayer] aimed at maximum performance,
simplicity and memory efficiency.

includes:

* a lot of other bits and pieces accumulated from nearly 8 years of working with Go, logging and
 run control, user data directories (windows, mac, linux, android)
* a cleaned up and unified fork of the btcd/dcred BIP-340 signatures, including the use of
 bitcoin core's BIP-340 implementation (more than 4x faster than btcd)
* AVX/AVX2 optimized SHA256 and SIMD hex encoder
* https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1[libsecp256k1]-enabled signature and signature verification
 (see link:p256k/README.md[here])
* a bespoke, mutable byte slice based hash/pubkey/signature encoding in memory
* custom badger based event store with a garbage collector that prunes off data with least recent
 access
* vanity npub generator that can mine a 5 letter prefix in around 15 minutes on a 6 core Ryzen 5
 processor
* reverse proxy tool with support for Go vanity imports and https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md[nip-05] npub DNS verification and own
 TLS certificates

== Building

If you just want to make it run from source, you should check out a tagged version. The commits on these tags will
explain what state the commit is at. In general, the most stable versions are new minor tags, eg v1.2.0 or v1.23.0, and minor
patch versions may not be stable and occasionally may not compile (not very often).

== Repository Policy

In general, the main `dev` branch will build, but occasionally may not. It is where new commits are added once they are
working, mostly, and allows people to easily see ongoing activity. IT IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE STABLE.

Sometimes there will be a github release version, as well, these will be the most stable version.

Currently this project is in active development and currently v1.2.9 is quite stable but there may be bugs still.

NWC integration is being worked on currently to enable in-app easy subscription management without any extra interface
tooling, just standard nostr client zap and DM functionality, similar to how access control management already is
configured simply by making a nostr identity and setting its follows to those you want to be able to read and post, and
mutes to those whose events will never be stored on the relay, no matter if the user publish them to it.

== CGO and secp256k1 signatures library

By default, Go will usually be configured with `CGO_ENABLED=1`. This selects the use of the
C library from bitcoin core, which does signatures and verifications much faster (4x and better)
but complicates the build process as you have to install the library beforehand. There is
instructions in link:p256k/README.md[p256k/README.md] for doing this.

In order to disable the use of this, you must set the environment variable `CGO_ENABLED=0` and
it the Go compiler will automatically revert to using the btcec based secp256k1 signatures
library.

----
export CGO_ENABLED=0
cd cmd/realy
go build .
----

This will build the binary and place it in cmd/realy and then you can move it where you like.

=== Static build

To produce a static binary, whether you use the CGO secp256k1 or disable CGO as above:

----
go build --ldflags '-extldflags "-static"' -o ~/bin/realy ./cmd/realy/.
----

will place it into your `~/bin/` directory, and it will work on any system of the same architecture with the same glibc major version (has been 2 for a long time).

== Configuration

The default will run the relay with default settings, which will not be what you
want.

To see the curent active configuration:

----
realy env
----

This output can be directed to the profile location to make the settings
editable without manually setting them on the commandline:

----
realy env > $HOME/.config/realy/.env
----

You can now edit this file to alter the configuration.

Note the configuration file is a "dotfile" so that if you are tinkering with the
code you can wipe out a broken database with:

----
rm -rf $HOME/.config/realy/*
----

and it leaves the config because this doesn't match a standard wildcard, all the
database files wil be removed, however.

Regarding the configuration system, this is an element of many servers that is
absurdly complex, and for which reason Realy does not use a complicated scheme,
a simple library that allows automatic configuration of a series of options,
added a simple info print:

----
realy help
----

will show you the instructions, and the one simple extension of being able to
use a standard formated .env file to configure all the options for an instance.

== Administrative functions

You can export everything in the event store through the default http://localhost:3334 endpoint
like so:

----
curl -u username:password http://localhost:3334/export > everything.jsonl
----

The username and password are configured in the environment variables 

----
ADMIN_USER=username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
----

Note that HTTP basic authentication this can only be alphanumeric values, but
make it long and strong because these functions are sensitive.

Or just all of the whitelisted users and all events with p tags with them in it:

----
curl -u username:password http://localhost:3334/export/users > users.jsonl
----

Or just one user: (includes also matching p tags)

----
curl -u username:password http://localhost:3334/export/4c800257a588a82849d049817c2bdaad984b25a45ad9f6dad66e47d3b47e3b2f > mleku.jsonl
----

Or several users with hyphens between the hexadecimal public keys: (ditto above)

----
curl -u username:password http://localhost:3334/export/4c800257a588a82849d049817c2bdaad984b25a45ad9f6dad66e47d3b47e3b2f-454bc2771a69e30843d0fccfde6e105ff3edc5c6739983ef61042633e4a9561a > mleku_gojiberra.jsonl
----

And import also, to put one of these files (also nostrudel and coracle have functions to
export the app database of events in jsonl)

----
curl -u username:password -XPOST -T nostrudel.jsonl http://localhost:3334/import
----

You can also shut down the realy as well:

----
curl -u username:password http://localhost:3334/shutdown
----

Other administrative features will probably be added later, these are just the
essentials.
